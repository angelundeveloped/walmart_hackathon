---

Dear Walmart Hackathon Judges,

I am excited to submit our project **Walmart Wavefinder** for the Walmart Hackathon. This innovative solution addresses a critical pain point in the retail shopping experience: helping customers efficiently navigate large stores to find their items.

## Project Overview

**Walmart Wavefinder** is an AI-powered in-store navigation system that combines cutting-edge technologies to revolutionize the shopping experience:

- **ü§ñ AI Shopping Assistant**: Natural language chat interface powered by Google's Gemini API
- **üìç UWB Positioning**: Simulated Ultra-Wideband positioning for precise cart tracking
- **üõ£Ô∏è Smart Pathfinding**: A* algorithm for optimal multi-stop route planning
- **üì± Responsive Design**: Seamless experience across desktop and mobile devices

## Key Features Demonstrated

### 1. Intelligent Item Recognition
- Natural language processing to understand shopping requests
- Automatic item extraction and coordinate mapping
- Support for various request formats ("I need milk and bread", "Add snacks to my list")

### 2. Advanced Navigation System
- Real-time UWB positioning simulation with noise injection
- Trilateration algorithms for accurate cart location
- Dynamic route calculation with obstacle avoidance

### 3. Optimized User Experience
- Proximity-based item sorting (closest items first)
- Visual feedback with category icons and section labels
- Real-time route updates as items are found
- Professional Walmart-branded interface

### 4. Technical Excellence
- Built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- Production-ready with comprehensive error handling
